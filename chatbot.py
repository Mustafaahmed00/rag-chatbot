    "Strength training builds muscle and includes squats, deadlifts, and presses. Progressive overload is key - gradually increase weight or reps.",
    "Protein is essential for muscle recovery and is found in eggs, fish, and tofu. Aim for 1.6-2.2g per kg body weight daily.",
    "Cardio improves heart health and burns fat. Examples: running, cycling, HIIT. Start with 150 minutes moderate or 75 minutes vigorous weekly.",
    "Sleep (7‚Äì9 hrs) helps recovery and hormone regulation, critical for fitness progress. Deep sleep is when muscle repair happens.",
    "Healthy fats (avocados, olive oil, nuts) are essential for brain and hormone health. Include 20-35% of daily calories from fats.",
    "Complex carbs (like oats, rice, quinoa) provide long-lasting energy for workouts. Eat 2-3 hours before exercise for best performance.",
    "Drinking water helps metabolism, digestion, and physical performance. Aim for 8-10 glasses daily, more during exercise.",
    "Weight loss = calorie deficit; weight gain = calorie surplus. Both require consistency. Track your progress for best results.",
    "Micronutrients like magnesium, iron, and vitamin D support muscle and energy systems. Consider a multivitamin if deficient.",
    "Supplements like creatine, whey protein, and multivitamins can support fitness goals. Creatine is the most researched supplement.",
    "Rest days are crucial for muscle growth and injury prevention. Overtraining can lead to burnout and decreased performance.",
    "Form is more important than weight. Poor form can cause injuries and limit progress. Start light, perfect your technique.",
    "Consistency beats perfection. Working out 3-4 times weekly consistently is better than sporadic intense sessions.",
    "Mind-muscle connection improves workout effectiveness. Focus on feeling the target muscle work during exercises.",
    "Progressive overload principle: gradually increase resistance, reps, or sets to continue making gains.",
    "Compound exercises (squats, deadlifts, bench press) work multiple muscle groups and are more efficient than isolation exercises.",
    "HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) burns more calories in less time and improves cardiovascular fitness.",
    "Flexibility and mobility work prevent injuries and improve performance. Include stretching in your routine.",
    "Nutrition timing matters: eat protein within 30 minutes post-workout for optimal muscle recovery.",
    "Mental health and fitness are connected. Exercise reduces stress, anxiety, and improves mood through endorphin release."
